# Security Policy
## Supported Versions
Use the latest version of Extra Vanilla. It will automatically tell you if you're using an outdated version.

## Reporting a Vulnerability
Please report vulnerabilities with the "Security report" issue. Once we're aware of it, we'll try our best to fix it, and to keep you in the loop.

It's unlikely that we'll reject the security report, the only reason that we might is if it breaks everything else to fix it.
