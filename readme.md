# ExtraVanilla.JS
A Clientside JavaScript library to make working with many features of Vanilla JavaScript easier.

Also, I didn't write 100% of this, but I did write most of it.

# Installation
Download `extravanilla.min.js` from the downloads directory, then import it into your website. There is currently no CDN links.

# Editing
The Extra Vanilla source JS file is in the root directory, it has the name of `vanilla.js`, the version that should be used on websites in the `download` directory named `extravanilla.min.js`. Make sure that when your finished editing the source, minify it, and then put it into `/downloads/extravanilla.min.js` as  line 2.
